# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2021.

## Structure

Within the `src` folder are numbered folders corresponding to each day.
Each day contains two files with the solutions to the two challenges, as
well as a `README` with my comments and lessons learned for the challenges
of that day.

## Languages Used

I am attempting to use a different programming language for each
day, althougb I will repeat if I have to.

| Day | Challenge Name       | Language |
| --- | -------------------- | -------- |
| 1   | Sonar Sweep          | C        |
| 2   | Dive!                | Python   |
| 3   | Binary Diagnostic    | C++      |
| 4   | Giant Squid          | Rust     |
| 5   | Hydrothermal Venture | ~~Ruby~~ |
